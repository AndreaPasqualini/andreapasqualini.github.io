I am Andrea Pasqualini, a PhD Candidate at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/).
This is my personal website.
Think of it as a modern CV.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/apsql/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apsql), where you will find I prefer sharing code than tweets.

You can find my webpage on Bocconi's website [here](http://didattica.unibocconi.eu/docenti/cv.php?rif=185848&cognome=PASQUALINI&nome=ANDREA), although it is not very interesting.
I am also listed among Bocconi's [current PhD students](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+economics+and+finance/phd+students/copia+di+current+phd+students+in+economics+_+finance_acquati+2011+09+30+11+21).
