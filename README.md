# Personal Website

This repository hosts my personal website.
GitHub serves apsql.github.io using the files in this repo.
If you are interested in learning more about me, then this repo is useless to you.
If, instead, you want to learn how I did this website, then read on.


## Build Instructions

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


### First setup

The initial setup of this folder has been carried out by executing

    gem install bundler jekyll
    jekyll new apsql.github.io

This delivers a minimal working Jekyll setup based off the [Minima Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
