# Personal Website


## Build Instructions

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


### First setup

The initial setup of this folder has been carried out by executing

    gem install bundler jekyll
    jekyll new apsql.github.io

This delivers a minimal working Jekyll setup based off the [Minima Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
