# La Strada Seminar Series

In academic year 2016-2017, a PhD student named Peter Schmidt started a small seminar series in Bocconi.
It used to be called "Peter's seminar".
It was an occasion for PhD students.
Either they were presenting for their first time, or they were presenting ideas for the first time.
The point was: trying stuff in a safe place, far from harsh behavior, but still with honest feedback.

In September 2017, Blanka, Giacomo and Matteo picked up the seminar series and renamed it "La Strada", after the popular bar we usually would meet on Wednesdays night.

Now the seminar series is a healthy recurrent event, with plenty presenters and a rich, diverse audience.
The spirit remained unchanged though.
PhD students present their projects at La Strada Seminars with the idea of receiving feedback from peers.

While I have always been enthusiastic about the initiative and have followed it quite closely,
I proudly joined the organizing team for the Spring 2020 iteration.
