My main research interests are in Financial Intermediation and Macroeconomics.
I work on questions related to bank heterogeneity and bank market power, keeping an eye on policy-relevant questions such as monetary policy transmission and financial stability.

I will join the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk) at [Oxford University](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), as well as [Lincoln College](https://lincoln.ox.ac.uk/), as a Career Development Fellow on September 2021.
