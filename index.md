## Research
I am currently exploring bank heterogeneity and the role of the interbank market in the transmission of financial shocks and the unfolding of systemic events.
My field paper tries to understand why we observe bank heterogeneity in a closed economy.

I am also interested in Time Series Econometrics and I plan to work on it in the future.
