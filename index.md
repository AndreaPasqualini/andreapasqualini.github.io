## Other Interests

Other than academic work, I also like programming in Python, learning how to use web technologies and designing webpages.
I like custom-building desktop PCs.
And I do some videogaming, especially FPS and racing games.


### GitHub projects

I have some code on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/apsql/).
Most of the public code is MIT-licensed, which means you can do whatever you like with it, as long as you give credit where due.
Most notably:

- Python wrapper using the [`google-api-python-client`](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/) for the Custom Search Engine product
- Own Econometrics toolbox (WIP)
- Own Economic Models toolbox (planned, mainly Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari-type models and linear rational-expectations models)
- Code for the PhD course in Numerical Methods for Macroeconomics (aka Macroeconomics 3) (WIP)
