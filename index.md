## Curriculum Vitae

You can find my CV [here](/files/cv.pdf).


## Research

I am currently exploring bank heterogeneity and the role of the interbank market in the transmission of financial shocks and the unfolding of systemic events.
My field paper tries to understand why we observe bank heterogeneity in a closed economy.

I am also interested in Time Series Econometrics and I plan to work on it in the future.

## Other Interests

Other than academic work, I also like programming in Python and learning how to use web technologies.
I like custom-building desktop PCs.
And I love videogaming, especially FPS and racing games.


### Python projects

I will probably upload the code of the following libraries I am working on here on GitHub.

* Python wrapper using the [`google-api-python-client`](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/) for the Custom Search Engine product (WIP)
* Port of [LeSage's Matlab toolbox](http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/) (WIP)
* Own Econometrics toolbox (WIP)
* Own Economic Models toolbox (planned, mainly Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari-type models)
