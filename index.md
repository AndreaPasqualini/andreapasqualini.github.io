# Welcome!

I am Andrea Pasqualini, a PhD candidate in Economics at Bocconi University.
Currently enrolled in the 5<sup>th</sup> year.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<img src="/assets/img/picture.jpg" align="right" alt="Profile picture" class="inline">

My main research interests are in Empirical Industrial Organization, Financial Intermediation and Macroeconomics.
I'm particularly interested in understanding how markups in the banking sector affect bank-specific issues, such as credit allocation and risk-taking behavior.

You can read more about me in the [About page](/_pages/about.md).
