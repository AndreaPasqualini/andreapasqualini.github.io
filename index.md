## Other Interests

Other than academic work, I also like programming in Python, learning how to use web technologies and designing webpages.
I like custom-building desktop PCs.
And I do some videogaming, especially FPS and racing games.


### Python projects

I will probably upload the code of the following libraries I am working on here on GitHub.

* Python wrapper using the [`google-api-python-client`](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/) for the Custom Search Engine product
* Port of [LeSage's Matlab toolbox](http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/) (WIP)
* Own Econometrics toolbox (WIP)
* Own Economic Models toolbox (planned, mainly Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari-type models)
* Code for the PhD course in Numerical Methods for Macroeconomics (aka Macroeconomics 3) (WIP)
